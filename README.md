This project presents a detailed farm performance analysis for Eatwell Agro across its regional farms for the year 2024. It was developed using Excel to visualize key agricultural indicators such as crop yields, fertilizer and pesticide usage, soil types, and seasonal farming outcomes. The dashboard helps stakeholders identify the most productive farms, optimize resource use, and make data-driven decisions to enhance sustainable farming practices.

**Data Source**

The dataset was collected from Eatwell Agro's regional farm operations and includes:

* Crop Yields (in tons)
* Fertilizer and Pesticide Usage (in tons)
* Farm Sizes (in acres)
* Soil Types (Clay, Loamy, Sandy, Silty)
* Seasonal Patterns (Zaid, Kharif, Rabi)
* Most Farmed Crops and Best Performing Farms

The data was cleaned, transformed, and structured in Excel before importing into Power BI for visualization and analysis.

**Dashboard Highlights**

The dashboard is designed to offer a concise and interactive view of:

* ✅ **Top-performing crops** by yield (Tomato, Barley, Soybean)
* ✅ **Best seasons** for farming (Zaid season leads with 47.61%)
* ✅ **Most efficient farms** by size and output (F024, F008, F028)
* ✅ **Soil type distribution**, with Clay performing best
* ✅ **Fertilizer and pesticide usage** patterns across crop types

**Key Insights**

Tomato is the highest-yielding crop at over 200 tons.
Zaid season provides the best farming results.
Clay soil supports the most productive farming.
F024 is the largest farm (483.88 acres), while F028 delivers the best yield.
Cotton and Barley are the most widely farmed crops (7 farms each).
Barley leads in fertilizer use, while Cotton tops pesticide usage.


**Recommendations**

Focus on tomato and barley cultivation in farms with clay soil during the Zaid season for maximum yield.
Optimize fertilizer and pesticide use by monitoring crops like Cotton and Tomato closely.
Leverage insights from top farms like F024 and F028 to replicate best practices across smaller farms.

Conclusion

This Excel project offers a data-driven snapshot of regional farm operations for Eatwell Agro in 2024. It highlights key success factors in crop performance, soil suitability, and seasonal trends. The insights derived support smarter agricultural planning, better input allocation, and sustainable farming across regions.
